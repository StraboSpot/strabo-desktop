This repository is for developing the 'desktop' strabo access application. 

Target users:
Microstructure data collector working with thin section images
Geologist in remote field site

Functions include:

1.  Finding and downloading data (complex queries, geographic search)
2.  Map browsing data
3.  Editing data (with access controls)
4.  uploading data to central dB
5.  downloading data from StraboMobile
6.  working with microstructure images (create spots)
7.  Store data in local workspace (Field camp disconnected from web; storage could be cloud or local machine)
8.  create new content models
9.  create new data entry forms
10. access workspace containing strabo data via web API so its agnostic about actual data lcoation

These various functions woiuld all be different web pages


Questions:
Needs to be able to function disconnected from central db
